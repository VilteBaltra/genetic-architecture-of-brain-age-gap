## Genetic architecture of brain age gap

This repository contains scripts and workflows for estimating brain age gaps (BAG), performing genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in individual cohorts, meta-analysing GWAS summary statistics, running genetic correlations, Mendelian randomisation, and polygenic score analyses.
