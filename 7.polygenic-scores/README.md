UK Biobank–specific code for brain age estimation, GWAS, and PheWAS
is provided at https://github.com/pjawinski/enigma_brainage (SBayesRC
weights as well as the scripts on how to apply them were generated by P.
Jawinski).  
  
This folder includes scripts used to derive polygenic scores in
Generation R  
- run.example.sh – an example script demonstrating how to run
pgs.predict.sh  
- pgs.predict.sh – the main script that uses PLINK2 to apply the
weights  
  
\# how to implement:  
\# open run.example.sh and update file paths  
\# make pgs.predict.sh executable by running:  
chmod +x pgs.predict.sh  
\# obtain all PGS scores by typing:  
./run.example.sh

### Polygenic scores scripts

This folder contains scripts for deriving polygenic scores in Generation R.  

UK Biobank–specific code for brain age estimation, GWAS, and PheWAS (including SBayesRC weights) is available at [pjawinski/enigma_brainage](https://github.com/pjawinski/enigma_brainage).

## Scripts

- `run.example.sh` – example demonstrating how to run `pgs.predict.sh`  
- `pgs.predict.sh` – applies weights using PLINK2  

## Usage

1. Update file paths in `run.example.sh`  
2. Make the main script executable:

```bash
chmod +x pgs.predict.sh # make pgs.predict.sh executable
./run.example.sh # run to generate PGS scores
```
